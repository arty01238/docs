# Scripting in Porla

Porla embeds [Lua 5.4](https://www.lua.org/) to let users customize it to their
liking.

Using Lua scripts, users can write workflows which are inspired by GitHub
actions and makes it possible to set up many kinds of user specific
integrations.

## Getting started

To get started, make sure to set the [`workflow_dir`](../configuration.md#workflow_dir) setting in your `porla.toml`
configuration file.
